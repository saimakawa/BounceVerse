📌 2D Elastic Collision Simulator

A real-time physics-based circle collision simulation built using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript.

🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates real-time 2D elastic collision between two moving circles using JavaScript Canvas. Both circles move dynamically and bounce off the walls. When they collide, realistic velocity reflection occurs along with a color change and collision message display.

🎯 Features
